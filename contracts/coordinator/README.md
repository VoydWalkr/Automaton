# VoydWalkr Vanguard Coordinator
*The Vanguard Coordinator of the VoydWalkr* fleet aggregates the efforts of each individual *Vanguard* (open orders) and communicates these back to HQ (you).

*Vanguard* consists of two core [Terra](https://terra.money/) contracts: *Vanguard* and *Coordinator*. The *Coordinator* acts as a registry of deployed/active *Vanguard* instances. Anybody may create a *Vanguard* and register or unregister it.
